options:
  domain-name:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      Name of the keystone domain to configure; defaults to the deployed
      application name.
  ldap-server:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      LDAP server URL for keystone LDAP identity backend.

      Examples:
      ldap://10.10.10.10/
      ldaps://10.10.10.10/
      ldap://example.com:389,ldaps://ldaps.example.com:636
      ldap://active-directory-host.com:3268/
      ldaps://active-directory-host.com:3269/

      An ldap:// URL will result in mandatory StartTLS usage if either the
      charm's tls-ca-ldap option has been specified or if the 'certificates'
      relation is present.
  ldap-user:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      Username (Distinguished Name) used to bind to LDAP identity server.
      For anonymous binding, leave ldap-user and ldap-password empty.

      Example: cn=admin,dc=test,dc=com
  ldap-password:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      Password of the LDAP identity server.
      For anonymous binding, leave ldap-user and ldap-password empty.
  ldap-suffix:
    type: string
    default:
    description: LDAP server suffix to be used by keystone.
  ldap-config-flags:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      Additional LDAP configuration options.
      For simple configurations use a comma separated string of key=value pairs.
      "user_allow_create=False, user_allow_update=False, user_allow_delete=False"
      For more complex configurations use a json like string with double quotes
      and braces around all the options and single quotes around complex values.
      "{user_tree_dn: 'DC=dc1,DC=ad,DC=example,DC=com',
        user_allow_create: False,
        user_allow_delete: False}"
      See the README for more details.

      Note: The explicitly defined ldap-* charm config options take precedence
      over the same LDAP config option also specified in ldap-config-flags.

      For example, if the LDAP config query_scope is defined in
      ldap-query-scope as 'one' and in ldap-config-flags as
      "{query_scope: 'sub'}" then the config query_scope is set to 'one'.
  ldap-readonly:
    type: boolean
    default: True
    description: LDAP identity server backend readonly to keystone.
  tls-ca-ldap:
    type: string
    default: null
    description: |
      This option controls which certificate (or a chain) will be used to connect
      to an ldap server(s) over TLS. Certificate contents should be either used
      directly or included via include-file://
      An LDAP url should also be considered as ldaps and StartTLS are both valid
      methods of using TLS (see RFC 4513) with StartTLS using a non-ldaps url which,
      of course, still requires a CA certificate.
  ldap-query-scope:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      This option controls the scope level of data presented through LDAP.
  ldap-user-tree-dn:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      This option sets the search base to use for the users.
  ldap-user-filter:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      This option sets the LDAP search filter to use for the users.
  ldap-user-objectclass:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      This option sets the LDAP object class for users.
  ldap-user-id-attribute:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      This option sets the LDAP attribute mapped to User IDs in keystone.
  ldap-user-name-attribute:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      This option sets the LDAP attribute mapped to User names in keystone.
  ldap-user-enabled-attribute:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      This option sets the LDAP attribute mapped to the user enabled
      attribute in keystone.
  ldap-user-enabled-invert:
    type: boolean
    default:
    description: |
      Setting this option to True allows LDAP servers to use lock attributes.
      This option has no effect when ldap-user-enabled-mask or
      ldap-user-enabled-emulation are in use.
  ldap-user-enabled-mask:
    type: int
    default:
    description: |
      Bitmask integer to select which bit indicates the enabled value if
      the LDAP server represents enabled as a bit on an integer rather
      than as a discrete boolean. If the option is set to 0, the mask is
      not used. This option is typically used when ldap-user-enabled-attribute
      is set to 'userAccessControl'.
  ldap-user-enabled-default:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      The default value to enable users. The LDAP servers can use boolean or
      bit in the user enabled attribute to indicate if a user is enabled or
      disabled. If boolean is used by the ldap schema, then the appropriate
      value for this option is 'True' or 'False'. If bit is used by the ldap
      schema, this option should match an appropriate integer value based on
      ldap-user-enabled-mask. Please note the integer value should be specified
      as a string in quotes. This option is typically used when
      ldap-user-enabled-attribute is set to 'userAccountControl'.

      Example:
      Configuration options to use for ldap schema with userAccountControl as
      control attribute, uses bit 1 in control attribute to indicate
      enablement.

      ldap-user-enabled-attribute = "userAccountControl"
      ldap-user-enabled-mask = 2
      ldap-user-enabled-default = "512"

      ldap-user-enabled-default should be set to integer value that represents
      a user being enabled. For Active Directory, 512 represents Normal Account.

      For more information on how to set up those config options, please refer
      to the OpenStack docs on Keystone and LDAP integration at
      https://docs.openstack.org/keystone/latest/admin/configuration.html#integrate-identity-back-end-with-ldap

  ldap-user-enabled-emulation:
    type: boolean
    default:
    description: |
      If enabled, keystone uses an alternative method to determine if a user
      is enabled or not by checking if they are a member of the group defined
      by the ldap-user-enabled_emulation-dn option.
  ldap-user-enabled-emulation-dn:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      DN of the group entry to hold enabled users when using enabled
      emulation. Setting this option has no effect when
      ldap-user-enabled-emulation is False.
  ldap-group-tree-dn:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      This option sets the search base to use for the groups.
  ldap-group-objectclass:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      This option sets the LDAP object class for groups.
  ldap-group-id-attribute:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      This option sets the LDAP attribute mapped to group IDs in keystone.
  ldap-group-name-attribute:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      This option sets the LDAP attribute mapped to group names in keystone.
  ldap-group-member-attribute:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      This option sets the LDAP attribute that indicates user is a member
      of the group.
  ldap-group-members-are-ids:
    type: boolean
    default:
    description: |
      Enable this option if the members of group object class are keystone
      user IDs rather than LDAP DNs.
  ldap-use-pool:
    type: boolean
    default:
    description: |
      This option enables LDAP connection pooling.
  ldap-pool-size:
    type: int
    default:
    description: |
      This option sets the size of LDAP connection pool.
  ldap-pool-retry-max:
    type: int
    default:

      to LDAP server before aborting.
  ldap-pool-connection-timeout:
    type: int
    default:
    description: |
      The connection timeout to use when pooling LDAP connections. A value of
      -1 means the connection will never timeout.
